**START UPDATE - August 2020**

# Easy instructions
For a simple and easy to follow demonstration of how to create, deploy and execute WebAssembly please read [this Medium article called Programming the Web with WebAssembly](https://medium.com/wasm/programming-the-web-with-webassembly-e90d17bde276)

# Feedback is very welcome
We have [an area devoted to feedback](https://github.com/second-state/wasm-joey/blob/master/FEEDBACK.md). Please feel free to raise any questions, issues and/or feature request via the link in this paragraph.

# Wasm-joey
A Joey is a baby Kangaroo. Wasm-joey is a **portable**, **flexible**, **lightweight** application for deploying and executing WebAssembly(Wasm) binary-code via HTTP requests and responses.

</p>

Wasm-joey is written in Node.js. It is easy to set up and deploy. All configuration is stored in the application's base directory. It can be deployed on any machine that can run Node. It's continual operation is performed via [HTTP](https://www.scaler.com/topics/hypertext-transfer-protocol/) requests and responses. This means that developers, end users and even computer-code itself can easily manage and execute WebAssembly code in a number of ways (including but not limited to) [Javascript (XMLHttpRequest)](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_http.asp), [jQuery(ajax)](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/), [Curl (command line/shell)](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.html#POST) or any HTTP REST client such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

# Simplicity
"Any program is only as good as it is useful" - Linus Torvalds. This application is being built to be as useful as possible. Part of achieving this involves putting in extra effort and design to ensure that it is as simple as possible, for you to use. Please create an issue if you have any ideas on how this application can be improved.
